	<p>Instances of classes implementing Composite must be immutable
		because the Graphics2D does not clone these objects when they are set
		as an attribute with the setComposite method or when the Graphics2D
		object is cloned. This is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of
		Graphics2D, resulting from the modification of the Composite object
		after it has been set in the Graphics2D context.</p>
