		<img class="top" src="images/logo.png" /> The Composite interface, along with
		CompositeContext, defines the methods to compose a draw primitive with
		the underlying graphics area. After the Composite is set in the
		Graphics2D context, it combines a shape, text, or an image being
		rendered with the colors that have already been rendered according to
		pre-defined rules. The classes implementing this interface provide the
		rules and a method to create the context for a particular operation.
		CompositeContext is an environment used by the compositing operation,
		which is created by the Graphics2D prior to the start of the
		operation. CompositeContext contains private information and resources
		needed for a compositing operation. When the CompositeContext is no
		longer needed, the Graphics2D object disposes of it in order to
		reclaim resources allocated for the operation
